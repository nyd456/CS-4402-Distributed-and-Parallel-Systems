This course studies the fundamental aspects of parallel systems and aims at providing an integrated view of the various facets of software development on such systems: hardware architectures, programming languages and models, software development tools, software engineering concepts and design patterns, performance modelling and analysis, experimenting and measuring, application to scientific computing.

Course topics include: 

multi-core, GPGPU, cluster, distributed and shared memory, hierarchical memory,
multi-thread (Julia, CilkPlus, OpenMP), multi-process, message passing (Julia, MPI),
scheduling (work-stealing scheduler) and synchronization,
parallel algorithm design and multithreaded program analysis: parallelism, granularity, memory bandwidth issue, scalability, data locality and cache complexity,
Intel Parallel Composer (Cilk Plus, ArBB, TBB), data race and performance analyzer (Cilkview, Vtune)
NVIDIA's CUDA for GPU
Message Passing Interface (MPI)
high-performance software engineering techniques,
fundamental applications: matrix multiplication, matrix transposition, FFT, reduction, scan, sort, etc.
